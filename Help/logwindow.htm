<H3>Log Window</H3>

This window will display 
<UL>
<LI>
internal logs about object creation/deletion
</LI>
<LI>
&quot;incoming&quot;
events, that is, COMView being called by hosted objects
</LI>
</UL>
The &quot;standard&quot; way to get events from a server in COM is through interface
IConnectionPointContainer, which must be exposed by the object. If this
interface is available, the hosting application may &quot;connect&quot; to the
object and will then be notified of certain events occuring. Therefore to see
events in the <i>Log</i> window you will have to:<BR>
<UL>

<LI>create an object exposing interface IConnectionPointContainer</LI>

<LI>in the
<a href="objectdialog.htm">object dialog</a> right-click an entry in the list of <i>outgoing
interfaces</i> and select menu item <i>Connect</i></LI>

<LI>open <i>Log</i> window if not already open. Incoming events will only
be logged if this window is open.</LI>

</UL>

With option <a href="optionsdialog.htm#OptionsGeneral">Log to debugger window</a>
all messages may be routed to a debugger.
Furthermore there exist some switches in 
<a href="optionsdialog.htm#OptionsObject">object options</a>
to influence the amount of messages displayed.
So for example it may be interesting to show the control's queries of ambient properties or
other methods of the OLE container. And COMView may be instructed to log all
calls to its IUnknown::QueryInterface methods.
