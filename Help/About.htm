Some of the functions are described in this help file in
more detail. But no introduction into COM is given here. So if you are
new to COM you possibly may find some explanations a bit
confusing and not very helpful. In this case search for more basic sources in the net, which
should be no problem at all.<BR><BR>

<font color="red">WARNING</font>
: Use COMView with great care! With COMView you may easily modify
critical registry entries. And creating objects, changing properties or
executing methods may cause severe data losses! If you don't know what you are
doing, you may easily get your computer to act &quot;strange&quot; (to say the
least). In any case save your work before starting this app!<BR>
