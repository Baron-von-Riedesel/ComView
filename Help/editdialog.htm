<H3>Edit Registry Dialog</H3>

This dialog implements a registry editor 
which allows to view, change or delete the currently selected items.

<BR>&nbsp;<BR>

<IMG SRC="editdialog.gif" Border=2><BR>&nbsp;<BR>

Please note that modifications of keys or values are
made permanent if you select another line inside the dialog. The
<i>Cancel</i> button will cancel the current edit operation, but it will
NOT undo insertions, deletions or changes done so far!

<BR>&nbsp;<BR>

The editor is capable to edit registry entries of type REG_SZ (+REG_EXPAND_SZ),
REG_MULTI_SZ, REG_DWORD and REG_BINARY. Items the editor cannot handle are displayed as '?'
and cannot be edited of course.

<BR>&nbsp;<BR>

Another point to mention is that comparing Win9x with WinNT platforms
there are some slight differences regarding registry functions. On Win9x systems
there always exists a default value when calling RegQueryValueEx, but not when 
enumerating values with RegEnumValue function. This is not the case on WinNT/2K/XP
systems.


<BR>&nbsp;<BR>

<B>To avoid fatal damage
you won't be allowed to delete entries <i>CLSID</i>, <i>Typelib</i>,
<i>Interface</i> or <i>AppId</i></B>.

<BR>&nbsp;<BR>

What is shown in the editor depends on the view it has been started from.
The additional keys listed below will be included only if they exist, of course.
<UL>
<LI><B>CLSID View</B>: referenced <i>TypeLib</i>, <i>ProgId</i>,
<i>VersionIndependantProgId</i> and <i>AppId</i> entries will be included.
This is especially useful if a CLSID shall be removed from registry.
But be careful with these type of actions.
The recommended way to remove a CLSID is to <i>unregister</i> the server.
Removing CLSIDs manually should only be considered if the binary implementing
the class is no longer available or is unable to unregister itself.
</LI>
<LI><B>Interface View</B>: referenced <i>TypeLib</i> and <i>CLSID</i> (in ProxyStubClsid32 subkey)
keys will be included.
</LI>
<LI><B>AppId view</B>: Key in value <i>AppId</i> will be included.
</LI>
<LI><B>HKCR view</B>: referenced <i>CLSID</i> key will be included.
If entry is a <i>file extension</i>, referenced <i>ProgId</i> in default value will be added.
</LI>
</UL>
