<H3>Generating ASM Include Files</H3>


In <a href="typelibdialog.htm">type library dialog</a> 
button <i>Create ASM Include</i> will create, after asking for a file
name, an ASM include file from the infos found in the type library. Mostly this
generated file can be used without modification in your source.
( if you are using MASM32, you might need 3 additional include files
which are contained in the WebBrowserSample: OBJBASE.INC, UNKNWN.INC and OAIDL.INC).

<BR>&nbsp;<BR>


To call a method through a vtable
use macro vf(), which is defined in OBJBASE.INC. To call methods of
dispatchonly interfaces, see <a href="dispatchhelper.htm">dispatch helper includes</a>.
<BR>&nbsp;<BR>

COMView does source generation in 2
passes, trying to rearrange types so dependant types will come last.<BR>

Include file generation may be done
quietly in &quot;batch&quot; mode with command line option &quot;/B&quot;
(example: &quot;COMView /B AsmCtrl.tlb&quot;). WARNING: in &quot;batch&quot;
mode COMView may overwrite existing files without user confirmation!<BR>

With option <B>Use Clipboard for
ASM includes</B> in <a href="optionsdialog.htm#OptionsTypeLib">type library options</a>
you may cause COMView to write its include files to the clipboard.

<BR>&nbsp;<BR>

A sample application
&quot;WebbrowserApp&quot; has been included to show how to use COMView
generated includes. This sample hosts Internet Explorer.<BR>
