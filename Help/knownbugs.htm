<H3>Known Bugs and Restrictions</H3>

<UL>
<LI><B>Consistency Check</B>: In some rare cases command
<a href="mainwindowmenu.htm#SpecialSubMenu">Check File Links</a>
will report a broken link which in fact is not.</LI>

<BR>&nbsp;<BR>

<LI><B>ASM Includes</B>: If a method
has more than 30 parameters (including <i>this</i>), MASM would complain
about &quot;statement too complex&quot;. So in this case - and if size of
parameter string is greater than 255 chars - the include generation process
comments out that prototype, replacing it by a simple one with one parameter so
the vtable offsets are calculated correctly.</LI>

<LI><B>ASM Includes</B>: The order of
STRUCTs in generated ASM include files sometimes may need to be rearranged a
bit.</LI>
